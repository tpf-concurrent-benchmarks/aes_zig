This is a Zig implementation of the [Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197-upd1.pdf).

The objective of this project is to analyze the concurrent capabilities of Zig, under various workloads, and to compare the performance between different languages.
